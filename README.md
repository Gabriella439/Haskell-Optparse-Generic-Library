# optparse-generic

Use this library to auto-generate a command-line interface that parses a typed
value.  This library uses Haskell's support for generic programming to
customize the command-line interface to the type of value that you request.

For example, the following program:

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric     #-}
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

import Options.Generic

data Example = Example { foo :: Int, bar :: Double } deriving (Generic, Show)

instance ParseRecord Example

main = do
    x <- getRecord "Test program"
    print (x :: Example)
```

... will generate a command-line interface that has one flag per field of the
record:

```bash
$ stack build optparse-generic
$ stack runghc Example.hs -- --help
Test program

Usage: Example.hs --foo INT --bar DOUBLE

Available options:
  -h,--help                Show this help text

$ stack runghc Example.hs -- --foo 1 --bar 2.5
Example {foo = 1, bar = 2.5}
```

This library also provides support out-of-the-box for many existing Haskell
types.  Try to run this program to see what command-line interface it generates:

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric     #-}
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

import Options.Generic

main = do
    x <- getRecord "Test program"
    print (x :: Either Double Int)
```

This library tries to be as intelligent as possible:

* Unlabeled fields become positional arguments
* Data types with multiple constructors auto-generate subcommands
* The `Maybe` type constructor translates to an optional flag/argument
* The `[]` type constructor translates to a repeated flag/argument
* `Any`/`All`/`First`/`Last`/`Sum`/`Product` also translate to repeated
  arguments, but with different behaviors (i.e. `First` will return the first
  option/argument that matches and `Sum` will sum them all)

## Development status

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Gabriella439/Haskell-Optparse-Generic-Library.png)](https://travis-ci.org/Gabriella439/Haskell-Optparse-Generic-Library)

I expect this library's API to be reasonably stable, but only time will tell.
Most changes will likely be related to adding new built-in support for
existing commonly used data types in the Haskell ecosystem by adding new
`ParseField`, `ParseFields`, or `ParseRecords` instances, but this will not
require any breaking changes to the API.
